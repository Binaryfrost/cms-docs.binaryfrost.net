You can upload files through the CMS.

By default, each file can be up to 50MB and each website can contain up to 5GB of files. However, the CMS administrator can change these amounts.

On the Media page, and when selecting files in a Collection Entry, you can see all files uploaded to your website. The icons below each file allow you to get the file URL or delete it.

:::note
Some files may be hidden when selecting files in a Collection Entry as your website administrator may only allow specific file types to be selected.

### Uploading Files

Clicking the file upload button will open a file uploader modal. Here, you can click to select a file, or drag and drop a file onto the modal.

Only one file may be uploaded at a time, and large file uploads may take a long time to finish.

:::caution
Do not upload confidential or otherwise sensitive files, as files can be accessed by anyone who has the URL. If you need to share such files through your website, contact your website developer to discuss development of a secure file sharing solution.
