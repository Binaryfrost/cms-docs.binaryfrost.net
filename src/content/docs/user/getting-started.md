Most pages in the SnowCMS dashboard will look like this:

![Page Structure](../../../assets/docs/user/layout.png)

The content of the sidebar differs depending on the page and your role.

At the bottom of the sidebar, you can:
- Switch between light and dark mode
- Manage your account
- Manage all accounts (only shown for admins)
- Log out
- Link to this documentation website
