  <Card title="Headless" icon="pencil">
    Unlike traditional CMSes, SnowCMS doesn't generate your whole website for you.
    Instead, it lets you create your website the way you want and manage just the
    content through the CMS.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-tenant" icon="laptop">
    Multiple websites can be managed through the same SnowCMS instance. This saves costs,
    reduces maintenance, and makes rolling out updates much easier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extendable" icon="seti:pipeline">
    You can add custom Inputs, subscribe to events, and create your own HTTP routes by writing plugins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Source" icon="github">
    SnowCMS is open-source and released under the MIT license.
  </Card>
