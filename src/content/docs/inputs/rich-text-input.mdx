title: Rich Text Input
---
import InputExample from '../../../components/InputExample.astro';

Renders a feature-filled rich text input.

<InputExample image="rich-text" />

:::caution
Each page should have only one Heading 1 (H1) which is typically used for the page title by your website developer. To avoid duplication and maintain proper structure, do not include an H1 in the rich text input. Use Heading 2 (H2) for section headings and Heading 3 or smaller for sub-sections as needed. When in doubt, contact your website developer.
